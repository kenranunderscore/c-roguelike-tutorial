# Following the [The C Roguelike Tutorial](https://dev.to/ignaoya/the-c-roguelike-tutorial-part-0-the-setup-1pfo)

Unfortunately it seems to be discontinued, which I only realized after
doing the first few parts.  I'm not sure whether continuing is worth
it now.  I might follow one of the `libtcod` tutorials from
[/r/roguelikedev](https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev) instead, but
there's none for pure C.
